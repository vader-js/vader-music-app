# Vader's Music App

## As the name implies, this is simply a music app designed without a single api call

# Description
This  project was born as a result of my love for music. i was scrolling through Twitter a couple of weeks ago and i came across a challenge coined as "November challenge for FrontEnd Developers" and this piqued my interest, you can't imagine how stimulated i felt when i found out it was about building a music app with a breathtaking UI(The UI was designed by the challenge creator,i guess), so i decided to take this challenge on and 'oh was it a challenge. After a couple of weeks i birthed something beyond my imagination, sometimes i manage to impress myself!.
Anyways, this design is not a full blown application as it has no BackEnd to it, hence i have only four songs stored on the app and it can be played, paused, skipped, returned, repeated etc. 
A pictorial representation of my finished App:
